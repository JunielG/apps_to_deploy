I've created a comprehensive Streamlit app for loan approval prediction! Here are the key features:
üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction System
Key Features:

## Data Overview Page
Summary statistics and metrics
Interactive data visualizations
Feature distributions and correlations
Default analysis by different factors

## Model Training Page
Choice between Random Forest and Logistic Regression
Configurable parameters (test size, random state, etc.)
Real-time training with performance metrics
Confusion matrix and classification report
Feature importance visualization


## Loan Prediction Page
User-friendly form for entering applicant information
Real-time prediction with probability scores
Risk assessment categories
Visual feedback for approval/rejection

## Model Performance Page
Detailed evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
ROC curve with AUC score
Prediction probability distributions

## To Run the App:
Save the code as loan_app.py
Make sure your loans.csv file is in the same directory

## Install required packages:
bashpip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

## Run the app:
bash
streamlit run loan_app.py

## App Structure:
Navigation: Sidebar with four main pages
Responsive Design: Modern UI with custom styling
Interactive Visualizations: Using Plotly for dynamic charts
Machine Learning: Integrated ML models with real-time training
User Experience: Intuitive interface with clear feedback

The app automatically handles data preprocessing, converts the "Default" column to binary format, and provides comprehensive analysis tools for loan approval prediction. Users can train models, make predictions, and evaluate performance all within the same interface.
