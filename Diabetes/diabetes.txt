I'll create a Streamlit app for diabetes prediction using your dataset. This app will include data exploration, visualization, and machine learning prediction capabilities.I've created a comprehensive Streamlit app for diabetes prediction with the following features:

## Key Features:

1. **ðŸ“Š Data Overview Page:**
   - Dataset statistics and summary
   - Missing values check
   - Feature descriptions

2. **ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization Page:**
   - Outcome distribution pie chart
   - Age distribution by diabetes outcome
   - Interactive feature distributions
   - Correlation matrix heatmap
   - Box plots for feature analysis

3. **ðŸ¤– Model Training Page:**
   - Multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM)
   - Feature selection
   - Model evaluation with accuracy metrics
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - Feature importance (for Random Forest)

4. **ðŸ”® Make Predictions Page:**
   - Interactive input form for patient data
   - Real-time predictions
   - Risk probability gauge
   - Health recommendations

## To run this app:

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
   ```

2. **Update data loading:**
   Replace the sample data generation in the `load_data()` function with:
   ```python
   @st.cache_data
   def load_data():
       return pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_app_name.py
   ```

## Features included:
- **Modern UI** with custom CSS styling
- **Interactive visualizations** using Plotly
- **Multiple ML models** with comparison capabilities
- **Real-time predictions** with risk assessment
- **Health recommendations** based on predictions
- **Responsive design** with proper layout

The app is designed to be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users, with clear explanations and medical disclaimers. You can easily extend it by adding more models, features, or visualization types.
